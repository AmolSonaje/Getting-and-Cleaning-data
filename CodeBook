Tidy data set description
The variables in the tidy data
Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.
Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
The tidy data contains 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels).

variable units
Activity variable is factor type. Subject variable is integer type. All the other variables are numeric type.

Code Summary:
Variables: (reading data)
1. X_train: Data from X train file
2. Y_train: Data from Y train file
3. Sub_train: Subject train data
4. X_test: Data from X test file
5. Y_test: Data from Y test file
6. Sub_train: Subject test data
7. variable_names: features file data
8. activity_labels: activity_lables file data


Calculated Variables and step wise explanations: 
1. X_total: Total of X data set
2. Y_total: Total of Y data set
3. Sub_total: Total of subject data set 
4. selected_var: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Next step is to apply this to X_total
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set i.e. create Y_total$activitylabel
7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
8. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
9. total: Is the table of combination of X_total, activitylabel, Sub_total
10. total_mean: Groupby of activitylable with respect to subject further summarised by mean
11. Write this to the tidy data output
